0:00
while cut greatest applause ever
0:03
well okay so we'll try this one again
0:06
you I am and what I'm going to be talking about its so
0:09
my name as was very kindly mention is recalling a smack me or how the spiny
0:13
depending on which country I'm in and
0:15
what people  saying I live in South African Pittsburg Bay you don't
0:19
need to remember that there won't be a test
0:21
yes and you may know me if you see me on reddit to Twitter you may know me as
0:25
fluffy pony
0:26
the and that's a discussion for another time so today I may be talking a little
0:30
bit about why privacy matters
0:32
I we can talk about fifty Shades a privacy because obviously it is a
0:35
concern is not so I'll
0:37
solutions are not very good solutions as well
0:41
and in what manner is and does I the people behind in a row
0:45
how we're trying to make it useful and usable and the future Mineiro
0:49
so each Srey privacy matters
0:52
so this is the popular we don't talk about drugs is otherwise
0:56
you know Mike is a little more privacy than that
1:00
because the thing is privacy is not just a criminal's
1:04
privacy so everyone is actually important everyone she for example in
1:07
this is just talking about transactional privacy
1:10
if you don't have private transactions then
1:13
you could have admitted myspace your spending habits
1:16
you could have crime that's targeted against the wealthy
1:19
and they know how much money you have and when you have it as opposed to
1:23
indirectly being able to view
1:25
what you have they could be unintended unintended any kids are sorted
1:29
purchases so the people at work know that you went around the corner and
1:32
bolted
1:33
bought a dildo and thats terrible its or you could have unwitting accomplices
1:37
complicity in criminal acts which of course is a big one in pat Quinn
1:41
you could receive coins that come from
1:44
the evolution exits care more from some exchange biased
1:48
and now suddenly you are the proud owner of some tainted but quite
1:52
and that's suddenly terrible because what open exchange that you wanna
1:55
deposit those coins to sis sorry we no longer exits
1:59
those claims no matter how far down the line it is
2:02
the if %uh sorry for taking any you know but
2:05
she and then of course is minor I'm censorship based on recipient we've
2:09
already seen this some
2:10
with but coin that some node since the I'm transactions that taught to or from
2:16
so touchy dice
2:17
and that's also you know ready quite frankly you
2:21
if somebody wants to gamble on SEDAR she die side in the minors have the right to
2:24
censor it but Nate
2:26
and it could reveal sensitive business relationship so I'm
2:29
it's it's all fine and well being able to know who the suppliers in the supply
2:32
chain of but you know when your competitor can see that
2:35
that's not great and for the same reason that's not ideal to leak salaries profit
2:40
margins and revenue a
2:41
so it on winning the topic of privacy comes up then but I my pet peeves comes
2:47
up as well which is the un-backed
2:49
and this happens a lot too but Quinn conferences people go its
2:52
all we're bringing back went to Africa I could no you're not
2:56
because the reality is that people in Africa and banks in Africa which makes
3:00
up 80 percent
3:01
I'll the sub-sahara population $326 million un-backed adults
3:06
they actually want to be on banks they'd
3:09
don't want to go and something money in a bank even though the
3:13
ability is they because they don't want the tax man to know and they don't want
3:17
sometimes appear taxi driver and you're part of the
3:20
you know you gotta affiliates owned by one guy you know when to bust a nut
3:24
like how much money you taking any because just skimming of the top
3:28
now you got a taxi driver and said let me tell you what did go in and
3:31
he's not KK because a it's difficult but
3:35
even if you get past that she doesn't want people to know what he's taking in
3:39
and what he's spending is
3:41
and and the caches amazing action and the context of the Africa is great
3:45
because it's Jeannie
3:46
Boston
3:47
most people will agree basically has no fees
3:50
the the issue that no one has sold until
3:53
more recently he is that cash let you operate private key
3:57
now 0 obviously we had a little bit earlier at about time
4:01
a very famous person I'm charm and we gonna get him in a moment's
4:05
cause he created love the breasts
4:08
private electronic cash and systems but
4:11
the issue that you have is that people don't KS
4:14
because as long as they can take bomb bull they're happy to give up that
4:18
their privacy and so this was a very interesting study called public
4:22
perceptions of privacy and security in the post snowed in the area
4:25
was conducted by Pew Research Center and they went around in the interview did
4:29
thousands of American adults and they say to them
4:32
amiss list of things to us which have them is very privates to you
4:37
and you know you start up for the topic a merican then they got social security
4:41
number that's critical because if they reveal that
4:44
their shrewd and people can take the social security number and open the
4:47
council get loans up
4:48
all I wanted to your emails you okay depaz would you be sent
4:52
on our somebody reads my emails is it that bad
4:55
all you dont like religious use 22 percent you know
5:00
the back at the day but to basic purchasing habits
5:03
a he said rest ninety-two percent a laquelle
5:06
can i play Fall Ball show up have my basic purchasing habits
5:10
but 0 the reality us is that perceptions are changing
5:15
and this is especially true amongst the coin is so going back to Tom
5:18
this is a great quote on reddit that spoke about however try cash is easy
5:23
Facebook candidates and private electronic cash is also not too
5:26
difficult because that was done in the nineties and
5:29
the story building but decentralized electronic cash is is tricky but
5:33
you know a bit consulted that'll the next day is decentralized private
5:37
electronic cash and that is the hottest the mall
5:40
now 0
5:42
nothing is we know what we once we want to
5:46
private when a cash but there lotsa solutions and a lot of people
5:50
according to have solutions to this and so
5:54
nothing is there been a buncha 10 said the Queen privacy
5:58
and some to a greater or lesser degree Mb mildly successful or unsuccessful
6:02
so the most common one is mixing and mixing is
6:06
kinda crummy because effectively what you're doing is you're saying a
6:09
a Los Angeles service please take my money and promise it'll give me some
6:13
money back
6:14
that is same but not the Saints and
6:17
relying on that as a solution well you know people have been burnt no continue
6:22
to be done its
6:23
going joined I'm is a a ready ready great
6:27
idea by Greg Maxwell the downside to call in join is that being ready bad
6:31
implementation is so shady point for example
6:33
was block Jenna impose implementation leg problems
6:37
I'm you know compete the like need the privacy that
6:41
said it had it didn't have I'm going Jones to do 'cause proved that wrong
6:46
then you got da call it also it you know and like finally maybe possibly a really
6:50
good point joint implementation but
6:52
Dockweiler just not getting traction from a development suspected
6:56
and just salute like sitting and and
6:59
you know the the lead developer disappears and then comes back and then
7:02
me attack he's not available wages because see some old
7:06
all summer doing something as it is an attraction is no development and
7:10
you know it was mister a line thus far privacy it's concerning
7:13
and then US a more recent join markets which I really like trying markets
7:17
basically like that to end up going join transactions
7:20
because what it does it hooks you up with somebody else that also once a day
7:24
according to a transaction
7:25
and it's all decentralized is no centralized the a server
7:29
and that's kinda bandied but the problem with that is that it's still limited
7:34
because all of these try to solve the privacy problem
7:37
but they don't solve the fund's ability issue and that goes back to what the
7:41
previous speaker was saying
7:43
about the finding money
7:44
help but point is not anonymous in up another the solutions change that
7:49
because that doesn't magically make pat Quinn fungible
7:52
okay
7:56
little posted being scam coin site old coins and alternatives
8:00
and the reason that most in the beans dams because developing decentralize
8:04
security software
8:05
is a lot harder than most people imagine so you got a non-core in which is not a
8:10
scam I
8:10
I quite like an ongoing guys but that was the first
8:13
and it was the one that was going to bring anonymous he
8:17
the crypto orchard to start to cook the currency transactions
8:21
and and also I mean they're just haven't had never really got off the ground they
8:25
did some cool stuff they
8:26
they did recited P integration forget the currency
8:29
but then beyond that they stumbled in there so said well we're gonna 20 cash
8:34
but then we're not going it is your cash in
8:35
no I'm ready knows what's happening its then you've got
8:39
some da plane dash Colleen I don't even know what they call today
8:43
and and apart from being plagued with very many problems like
8:48
and a pre mine and very very broken prufer were called a rhythm that just
8:53
slaps
8:54
all soft three candidates in a row in says its be made in you
8:57
then you order them those I'm they've got the single
9:01
things calm asta notes and now you're supposed to trust your privacy
9:05
J a buncha people running Austinites honey concerning it doesn't matter how
9:09
many of those they all are many
9:11
lost notes that appear to be but back to the matter is
9:15
there is one guy who owns 20 percent to the moss to its
9:18
and like that means that statistically speaking even if we're only talking
9:22
probabilities
9:24
your transaction which is meant to be private could poss to you
9:28
must nights and his control and that's not acceptable
9:31
then you got considered coins and mirror is
9:34
was originally a Krypton ok when the problem with alternative
9:37
all other kryptonite coins is there not keeping up to date with the things that
9:41
mean there are you doing they're not 0
9:43
reading a research paper is you're putting out to making adjustments
9:45
accordingly
9:47
and that mean they're also going to be stuck in the past with privacy that was
9:50
good but is not going to be getting up late Ron
9:53
I'll and then of course if you visit the Queen talk and
9:56
reading your posts is always a new Queen B
10:00
pushed that contains the sold everything in the world
10:04
but meanwhile turns out to be a scam and you'll find that a lot of them
10:08
navajo point and whatever when you actually go and look at what they're
10:12
doing they're just having a centralized mix under their control
10:15
so it's not even me yes it did ready is just
10:18
privacy theater all is no real privacy that
10:21
says now Paul you get to the cream of the crop
10:25
and ready when we're talking about good to currency
10:28
I'm the and look at the currency in general but you're talking about
10:32
you know which currency that is buckling like and Andrew talking about on sexual
10:36
privacy
10:37
they're ready only three currencies that week that weekend to talk about
10:40
miss but quite now pat Quinn is
10:43
it is fantastic and I really like that kind
10:47
downside all transaction date is visible all
10:50
upside it's all tested reviewed Republic PG&E
10:54
okay downside your privacy relies on the OPSEC about others all
10:59
upside well was not another upset that I could put on there
11:02
another downside is that privacy related features the late on know even now
11:07
days massive massive political hurdles
11:10
on Mon but Khan site adding them if somebody had to go along and submit a
11:13
pull request today
11:14
but added tons a transactional piracy to the Queen
11:17
it would face very strong pushback from a lot of people
11:21
just because of the the current standing in nature but going
11:25
then you got me in a row and will who get into details about what Minera does
11:30
and how it works
11:31
but your transaction data is not publicly visible at Sony bustle
11:35
by choice by you handing out your beauty your privacy therefore relies on you up
11:39
said
11:40
Nico Douga peas all be talking about crypto that was developed in the
11:44
eighties nineties
11:45
with some more recent stuff you know 2002 2007
11:49
but nothing completely was banging so that's great but then the implementation
11:53
still need some testing you know i mean the more lies the bed
11:57
that going bin Hamad all many years and they're going to be in Iran
12:00
you're the best but the other part is that we can continue to in Hans privacy
12:05
without facing much in the way political challenges because they appear ready
12:09
private
12:10
adding privacy doesn't ready to make a difference
12:13
and then you got 0.0 cash which is coming soon be promised
12:17
so they tell us and again I really like your coins are cash I do think in the
12:21
future
12:22
it's possible in in 15-20 years time that that's what we'll be using
12:27
will be using some wall looked up specifically but some derivative the
12:29
little
12:30
and that it's great because basically like this big black hole that
12:34
all transactions going to no one can tell what's happening
12:37
the downside is that the group logo PS so was bangin so in you that it's
12:42
completely untested
12:44
and that coupled with the big transactional black hole means that a
12:47
coin base transaction
12:48
well the equivalent to the Queen based on section if there was a bag in the
12:52
implementation could spew out
12:53
billions a Aug buzz iroquois in and no one would be able to tell
12:58
so that's an issue I'm but of course you know they have the same advantage that
13:02
they can continue to enhance privacy
13:04
so who knows you know the the future is pretty open from that perspective an
13:08
hour hold up I hope so that'd
13:10
but I do think that it needs a good ten to twenty years with all
13:13
up testing and betting reports reason he said
13:19
okay so what Minera is and does a no it's not a traditional Spanish breakfast
13:23
sausage with somebody actually Aust me
13:25
message is the mid-america I'm sure had one for breakfast
13:28
blessed know it's so Minera seeks to be truly and China private cash
13:34
so like we said its decentralized its electronic and its private
13:38
not to be seeking a when we talk about digital currency
13:41
lonely you only get you on the spot sometimes you need one but
13:45
you know for the most part like charm created cash that was
13:48
go tronic in private but it wasn't decentralized
13:52
and but quien is decentralize no tronic but not great private school
13:56
some in there is trying to do like all three
14:01
K so a very brief primer I'm in a risk Republic be because the narrow special
14:05
in the transactions of and linkable an untraceable
14:09
now when we use the terms and linkable an untraceable it means that that's
14:12
within a certain cryptographic key negligible measure of arrests the terms
14:16
and in couple an untraceable work with a cryptographic properties and i no way
14:19
endorsed by Wikipedia
14:21
the Guinness Book of World Records Inc autissier I'm by the hi5 special edition
14:25
by using software you agree to indemnify Alice bobbin all the agency not wrap up
14:29
in this Oct what might
14:30
let me say that because otherwise people go let God
14:33
unthinkable and untraceable great second just do whatever I want a new meaning
14:37
some testing and
14:38
then you got people on the other side of the pond that are going on it's not
14:41
really unthinkable untraceable because if you can crack it
14:44
256 bit hash then you'd break its and I'm like well if you can crack at 2:56
14:49
but has a lot more you can do choose
14:51
so home in a row works let's talk about unlink ability for us now
14:55
when we say cryptographic key and linkable what we mean the
14:59
is that what outgoing transactions if you take to outgoing transactions
15:03
it's impossible to prove that they were sent to the same person now a bit going
15:07
way back when works and
15:09
is usually see vaguely familiar with this considering that a bit going
15:12
conference
15:12
you got your private key from that to generate the public even you pay to hash
15:16
and be pretty much all transactions
15:20
gotta pay to that hash but aw destined for that
15:24
ash you can you top butts on the block Janelle
15:27
okay now with mirrored work-study differently what happens you got to
15:31
Jesus been key in a beauty
15:34
and you don't publisher has she published the actual public keys you
15:38
give them out to people
15:39
and in the Zazzle computations magical computation
15:43
takes each power obtain are putting will get into the power
15:46
10 stuff in a moment home and it's got this little home you know which is
15:49
basically just a hash function
15:51
me take a and even so you're hot you're public and
15:54
let me show you what you intend easy angie is the cryptographic base point
15:58
me and then are is this random that you choose
16:02
and so because you choose this random it means that we chop but I'll
16:05
they appear to be different even though the outputs are going to the same person
16:10
so practically and 0 this is how it works
16:14
let's say we want to send money now yes
16:18
our open after transaction and is a thousand men there that we're using as
16:21
an inputs
16:23
so what we do is we go okay this is going to the recipient in the break is
16:26
up in 2010 descending on 123 Mineiro
16:29
UK ok may go to the recipient and as you can see the destination
16:33
the appears to be different and that's what recording the Bachchan obviously
16:37
it's
16:37
longer in real life but you know the purpose is this
16:41
so if you look at you go well okay I can see they're going to the recipient
16:44
because they're one of the other hand yadda yadda
16:47
burn up yes %uh changes coming back in and the change also
16:51
looks like it's going to be random recipients into random destinations even
16:55
though the change is coming back to us
16:57
and when you look at it like this it's really easy cuz Marriott's recipients
17:01
not change
17:03
but once you do that all that it becomes a little complex
17:08
because when you look at the transaction Yukon see the amount that was sent
17:12
you can see there was more than one recipient you can see if there was any
17:15
change
17:16
or you can see is a bunch of putts that appeared to go to your ending
17:19
destination
17:21
what you hear you ask me a picture your alright
17:25
name so that's on traceability now the advantage that the UT gives us is it
17:30
actually creates a really nice
17:32
I'm regulatory compliance system
17:34
the but the advantage is that it's not regulatory compliance like with pat
17:38
Quinn way it's like i hey everything's exposed its regulatory compliance and
17:41
that you are the one who chooses
17:44
to expose your beauty you know compelled to at least not by
17:48
not by any technical system which but the government can come knock on your
17:51
door and say buddy give me your beauty
17:53
and you can choose to hand over your beauty which reveals all your
17:56
transactions
17:57
or you can go stuff you or you can give them one of your beauties and keep the
18:00
other ones a new mattress
18:02
and so in that way its it's great because it means that your privacy is
18:06
controlled by you
18:07
and also for I'm and ordered from an auditing perspective you can handle
18:11
yukio bitch in order to
18:13
and that order second order to year of the year but the constant your friends
18:17
all they can do is do you what you've done and you need to get in it
18:20
list of anything used a new key same for charities
18:24
charity single well we need public oversight all may be late on in future
18:28
governments could do this that could save many public oversight so Bruyere
18:31
beauties
18:32
go look at across sections mostly work with day and that's obviously like
18:36
highly advantageous because it means that from regulate re perspective we got
18:41
privacy but then also the ability to you to be compliant with regulation
18:46
on the model which means the privacy
18:49
is default a revealing your stuff is
18:52
optional UK so and traceability
18:56
well and traceability what that means that put incoming transactions
19:00
the they appear to be multiple senders and
19:03
the chance so they are you picking the correct send our love that smile
19:07
directly probable so your chances
19:09
one in Anaheim in the sand is the upmost so again to picking a good point we have
19:13
an input which is a
19:14
comes from a previously on Spain transaction output so
19:18
we put into the into a transaction we sign it using
19:22
s the sick aged 26 K one curve I'm
19:25
and
19:26
DS a signature and then we can speak in the conduction you can link
19:30
inputs back to the previous the unspent outputs now with Minera it's a little
19:34
bit different
19:35
because basically the there appeared to be multiple possible send is
19:40
that go into the single inputs and then we sided with ankle the ring signature
19:44
which
19:45
use more signatures me on an enemy to pop up 19 could
19:49
me and so what that means effectively is that we konden into transactions
19:53
back to the previous send so is to go back to top
19:57
a practical example yeah we have the one thousand men their input now we're gonna
20:01
figure out how we actually got it
20:03
so what we did what we've done is we gonna be taken all the one thousand in
20:07
there are pics on the bloodshed
20:08
one in red is all well that's when we actually hold private key to be
20:12
we don't know the private keys the rest today there on the block Jane
20:15
we can only see you know the public up but out
20:18
the public keys without but I'll sheesh and they will be due to pick a bunch for
20:22
them in this case we picked six
20:23
and we create this really awesome ring signature all now
20:27
in this part of the process we can see that that once the real one
20:31
but obviously night on once the ends up in the next transaction week on C which
20:35
one of those is the real world
20:36
but in order to avoid being able to spend that outputs
20:40
more than once we have this thing called the key image which is kinda like a hash
20:44
in the private key
20:45
little complicated not in this possible Republic be magic but for the purposes
20:49
of this discussion
20:50
it's like a hasher the private key which means if we had to go and try spending
20:54
to gain
20:55
we'd end up with a duplicate key image regardless of the state's
20:58
that we choose to mix West and that would I be seein be rejected by knows to
21:02
Lego your body this key images: already been sent spent
21:05
and so effectively what we end up with is that
21:09
and that's a typical Minera transactional so
21:13
so this is your input it's got this ring signature that was created and by the
21:16
way the ring signature claiming credit old-line
21:18
you need to be online you need to find PST mix with you just check the blog
21:22
changed
21:23
and found a bunch about butts and UN okay cool looking mixes East's
21:26
and Muscat Oman sizzle the the question of why we have these powers obtained for
21:30
each of us
21:31
the reason is because if US sending 123 point
21:35
9783 Mineiro to somebody chances are you're not going to find someone else to
21:40
mix with that use the same amount previously in the block Janelle
21:43
but if you're sending it broken on the POS obtained sudden you gotta mix we'll
21:46
set that much larger
21:47
so so the thing with many areas
21:52
yeah i cant so the privacy thing is kinda talking to pain
21:55
but it does other stuff to use so for example Mineros like the inflationary
22:00
and may have 2022 you begin a end up
22:03
getting a minimum blocker Walter 0.3 Minera and will stay that way forever
22:07
up which means the mean error is called
22:11
technically the term is likely disinflationary because
22:14
there's less than one percent inflation but that decreases your own yet
22:18
and the reason I we've done this is to retain mining incentives we don't want
22:21
to have a situation where
22:22
a the transaction fees all that your reliance on
22:25
I love mine is our online jobs then we have no block limits
22:30
we have a dynamic block the Mets
22:32
and what that does is that doesn't look back over the Boston
22:36
so days blocks and it's a median block size from that and it is OK
22:41
this is the median blocksize the next McInerney be like 20 percent large I'll
22:46
and so over time obviously if you create a block a stint when he was in law get
22:49
larger than the median goes up psyches
22:52
and overtime the block size limit increases just by virtue views
22:56
and if somebody had to come along and go well we're gonna like ramp up the block
23:00
size by artificially creating
23:02
thousands and thousands of transactions that's fine because the minute they run
23:05
outta
23:06
transaction fees and they stopped the block size limit goes back down
23:10
so they're not actually doing anything Sat being irritated
23:14
then we have a disconnected architecture which is kinda nice because it means
23:17
that you've only got one day man sitting on your computer talking to the network
23:21
is and you can run hundreds of wallets and roll I'm on your computer
23:25
and or you on your network and they only have to talk to the one single thing
23:28
that speaks to the
23:30
brought a yet to penetrate which is kinda handy former
23:34
all I you know cool from an integration perspective we came from a user
23:38
perspective because it means more than a home with an office you need to run one
23:42
node
23:42
is and we have different cryptography so if you're interested in
23:46
hedging against back when scripture which I don't breed think it's an edge
23:50
but anyway
23:52
we use e.g 5519 and crafty 5519
23:56
I'm which is basically Desa so were you saying created by Daniel J burns TN
24:01
is and pick on you sick p sick p226 k1
24:05
and ECDs a I'm night israelis you period but
24:08
if you're into %um paging system against the other than that's that
24:12
and we have an accessible people were called rhythm in what we mean by that
24:16
is
24:17
that at low as the performance gap between CP use GV use if the Jays in a6
24:22
so we're not a sick proof there's no such thing the but what we ought is some
24:27
in a way like we're a little bit difficultly 16 but a problem all
24:32
and we do this by leveraging a SN I extensions in Cebu's amongst other
24:36
things email me on and so on all
24:38
and the advantages is basically what it means is
24:41
I'm it inning whatever ten years time when they offer a six
24:46
then CPU mine is will still be okay they weren't make a profits
24:50
but they will still be able to mining whereas if you have to try mind that
24:54
point today with the seat you all
24:55
you know that's a bit of a joke so that some that's kinda bad want ages in that
25:00
it allows us to create some cool stuff
25:02
all now all obviously they are
25:05
I'm some people behind me there besides me and it's the
25:10
it but eventually Hama never got started so what happened was there was this dude
25:13
on
25:13
that point talk back what's day and he launched an air on April 18 2014
25:18
and do it a bunch of us have already excited me like oh this is cool what is
25:23
this and that was that
25:25
didn't use that point in some code was completely different
25:28
the I'm it was a fan on so the Kryptonite reference code
25:32
me and then thankful for today ended up being kind of a dick
25:35
because he didn't listen to the community and then eventually lack of
25:39
the
25:39
all like the committee voted against tough teams that know I'm gonna do this
25:42
and there's nothing you can do to stop me
25:44
and so we did stopping by Hawking Nobu
25:48
importing the repo and saying a bright pink ship we're not gonna implement that
25:52
and so we kinda took it over which is really interesting because it
25:55
the seven members are the core team he when sitting around going hey you should
25:59
start in all going in fact we didn't even know each other
26:02
all untold we ended up with was like
26:05
opened at: on the dole we had to raise
26:08
and and so basically our oldest you're checking
26:11
and
26:12
we've the with Greek columns into the fact that
26:15
we're just you ads and if we took it from someone his moms can take it from
26:19
us so
26:20
you don't have a position of power control widget
26:23
dead and they are like I said oh seven a bus
26:27
and on the 72 oversaw public in terms of
26:31
having our real name out there it and the other five
26:34
practice of sick to various daughter greater or lesser degree but
26:39
some many of them are quite well-known I'm
26:42
especially within the public currency community
26:46
I'm and there are of course many many many other contributors
26:49
I'm we have 25 contributors to the active contributors to you may recall
26:54
I'm we've got them in a research lab which are a bunch of academics and they
26:58
use usernames
27:00
and and then we got community contributors that
27:03
do everything from maintaining lists and documentation and
27:08
also suggests and adding stuff to the website and then we've got really cool
27:12
related software projects I'm the people work on
27:15
I'm meanwhile lets and
27:18
the mining pool because there was no compatible my nipples of great
27:22
I am and in all sorts of other things that tipping box and libraries
27:26
I'm PHP and node.js the is the ultimate libraries and also to stop on pipe in my
27:31
biz is all
27:33
okay and obviously we but possibly need to cover so the way we cover our costs
27:37
because we are driving around in Ferrari's
27:40
that happens next year good I the way we cover our costs is
27:44
always a good general donations and that's just mean people go hey you know
27:48
have some but going and they will never go
27:50
maple whatever when they send it to us and then we have service donations so
27:54
mining pools for example in some services contributes
27:57
I'm a portion of the the Prophet us
28:00
we have sponsors circuit weird I'm minor axis JetBrains a bunch of others
28:05
that contributed licenses and services now hosting and what not
28:09
us I'm and then we have this new new thing called the form funding system
28:13
way on the Minera forum I'm anady idea can be patched and discussed and then it
28:19
can be
28:20
can move from just an idea it actually picked up by somebody whether it's the
28:24
feature all or a purple service all
28:27
sent Lucky Penny to Europe to go into conference is whatever it is
28:31
and then that can be funded it is a a little bothered appears in this is well
28:35
you know yes they're not abandoning you need in this is how much he raised and
28:38
then people can sponsor
28:39
specific ventures a specific idea is and then
28:43
admission that into to work in progress section and then there's milestones that
28:47
can be set and
28:48
out so soap in moscow and that's kinda nice because it means that
28:52
are all then goes from much should be spent a very meager donations on
28:57
up to you overlook people can just contribute to that which is destroying
29:00
its
29:02
okay and and what we're trying to do is make me a useful and usable
29:07
because the Sun staging would actually like it to be grandparents trendy
29:12
so what we did more recently is the cradle single open a DS
29:16
and you can read more on open a test at all but basically he
29:20
it's just an open a missing system but never jus the existing infrastructure
29:25
all
29:25
at its most basic it's a txt recording DNS record and what that means is that
29:30
all I'm week we allow Paul familia para dimes
29:34
like paying an email address sichuan really sending anything to an email
29:38
address
29:39
all you're doing is you're unit changing the accent adoption doing at
29:43
TXT record lookup and obviously we need to make sure that there's some security
29:48
they're so used ain't DNS sick
29:50
and DNS sick is a chain of certificates from the roots
29:54
I outwards and if you don't want to use some ICANN's infrastructure no problem
29:59
you can use name-calling
30:00
and if you're worried about the privacy of you look ups well we have something
30:03
called DNS stripped which
30:05
is something that Open DNS created and we leverage
30:08
and DNA script basically just includes all of your DNS lookups
30:12
the advantage being that you ISP doesn't know what you're looking up
30:15
so you can make payments to you wreck at Exit Moda
30:18
act or donate but couldn't get near it at all
30:21
and no one knows and this is currently implemented an election
30:25
election 2.0 because it's not just common error its cool
30:28
it going and any other could guarantee infect the protocol that needed
30:32
implements its so election music from election 2.0 on Weds
30:36
and then I'm more there's a a wet one its
30:40
wind up space that also use it no obvious the merits of you lots
30:46
and we was a bean
30:50
trying to you I mean up at the one thing that that that mean their struggles a
30:53
bit with is I'm
30:55
at the moment it is Kaman line 0 nly we you have a bunch a third party
30:59
I'm grease but I miss the usability is a bit of an issue for people because
31:04
me apparently come online tools already ought to use your news
31:07
so it so we have my mean they're dot com and that's the way it while it's
31:12
it's currently the only way while it because I mean airway well it is kinda
31:15
that checking to do you I'm but that's a love handles the
31:20
accessibility Japanese in the short term and then also I'm getting there at all
31:24
which is our website
31:26
we've tried to and and is it on the content the still needs to be done by
31:29
the community but we've tried to make it
31:32
I'm easy for newcomers to read in an accessible and
31:36
that you know its name things in in reasonably simple terms
31:40
I'm because technical people are gonna go straight it back but going to look
31:43
horrible
31:44
and surveyed either website just looked like music oh my god I don't even know
31:48
what this is
31:48
explain it to me and we are of course working on agree
31:52
but we're working on it slowly because well I mean you know
31:55
we don't get paid is at so we we do any work as a man week and
32:00
but we started with wireframes an immediate attention designs for
32:03
components
32:04
and that's kinda what we ended up with and the codes up but it's not that close
32:08
up and it's the networking a snow white up in this
32:11
sunscreen just need to be done but it is kinda pretty and
32:14
and we think it'll be nice and useful and usable
32:19
so course the future Minera lost me because miracle 1.0 will be able to bake
32:24
your cake and eat it for you
32:26
almost
32:28
so what we're doing next is some
32:32
is very interesting in this the a lot of making the slide and
32:35
you know so the greeted you and diamond we got our Design and Development Goals
32:40
up on the website and they make you understand me too
32:42
shit but we doing a lot of stuff with the Queen basis to daughter chains
32:46
and we doing a lot of work with I'm library Ising
32:50
and all other it all the functions Cola ko punch ins
32:53
so instead of relying on you know hooking up by I'm
32:57
0 MQ RPC huge actually make calls
33:01
developers will be able to just drop macomb in their library intern
33:04
application and use its
33:06
only working on support which is more painful than anything I've ever done in
33:10
my entire life but soon you'll be able to draw sleep I'm in a row
33:16
and that is pretty much it thank you very much
33:18
any questions Wes
33:25
ball
33:27
myer well sports
33:30
I notable ok a
33:34
0 whatever sections to be at a scripting language embed it like that going nuts
33:38
this
33:39
making smart comports with them yeah we've got its very lightweight scripting
33:42
language so
33:43
so desire mes some scope for that
33:46
but I'll probably people was locked contracts because %uh the limitations or
33:51
the like which got 29 which
33:52
will do that and go to change rather than trying to get on main chain
33:56
I'm but the other is a scripting language so so you can do multi said for
34:00
example
34:01
although there's nothing that supports it and there is some limitations to be
34:05
MultiSync that slow and ring signatures that because the resulting
34:09
so yeah pro-choice also quite little bit that
34:13
ya general yep for is 10 a.m.
34:17
battle with all you that welcome like liking that work
34:21
so mean we looked at the Lightning at work in this some stuff that
34:24
let me find very interesting about the lighting at work but we r
34:27
so far away from you looking at at
34:31
implement anything like that that it's not even worth taking a serious look at
34:35
because we just be wasting our time
34:36
I'm what we are doing because we also do realize I'm
34:40
recognize the need for close to transactions not so the thing that
34:43
he got an experimental bought the chain which is so very i mean is that
34:47
it is but great radio code has been written but the idea is
34:51
that it will exist in parallel and settle back to the main chain on a daily
34:55
basis
34:55
and that is extremely Boston steamy light and can be discarded
35:00
you know all the pieces actions can be discarded every day so
35:03
so that's what we're looking at some playing around with because yet the
35:06
advantages daughter changes that not every single node needs to support them
35:10
so you can actually end up with like like really high-performance servers all
35:14
over the world that are supporting
35:16
list
35:16
particular chain and and it's all backed by the main chain
35:20
Anissa pigs in the main chain so anyway it is this stuff like that that might
35:24
when we get down to it it might not spell necessitates
35:29
need something like the Lightning it more habitat traditional so they haven't
35:33
spoke system but we'll see
35:34
similar me who all Orleans exits
35:38
at yes but book trying all bit point so so we've got a
35:42
we will muscle TX extra field I'm in a row which is bigger than opportunity
35:47
and you know you can shove me to date and that the extra
35:50
so there's nothing stopping anyone from doing a color coincident like
35:54
implementation and
35:55
up the downside of course would be that it'd be usable because Texas is not
36:00
all it's not good at all last look around too many think so it's also
36:03
like with that we've gotten their assets to be playing around with Google
36:07
and that but I mean we're talking about something coming up people yes not
36:10
neutral Aki
36:11
and and that we'll will have asset classes as separate chains and you'll be
36:15
able to do the
36:16
I'm federated pegging back to the main chain or you'll be able to do the
36:20
I'm swaps between chains not so that that so we ought to solve the the acid
36:24
issue but
36:24
maybe not necessarily by shuffling stuff into the main chain unnecessary the
36:29
at fun movie to a new expensive words can explain that
36:33
out say that mining a at all but safety is quite but
36:38
mining instructor is yeah this point already say that since
36:41
I'm not I don't believe any going to say fix it but going by Paul
36:45
Wikia me to be honest you know the the Naser a reasonable amount to pass rates
36:50
and it wouldn't be cheap to attack
36:52
but for a motivated attack a with them with the money in the bank they could
36:56
detect
36:57
the the mining into it quite Tribune the especially because
37:01
all they need to do is go buy a bunch like TV use you know that many many
37:04
specialized equipments
37:05
so so it's some if you're looking for like
37:09
like super like insane amount so of transactional safety on an ongoing basis
37:14
probably not the the best place to be right now at least not until
37:18
you know it's matured in the the money it would be growing
37:21
but if you're looking to you as a safe store a valued
37:24
you know then it's different because I mean you you put it into a cold wallets
37:27
and then
37:28
it's not exposed to issues with the mining at record it up
37:32
of you call you
37:35
yes since I'll was the whole
37:39
have you considered making me be calling some level
37:42
like go ok
37:45
the week the bases you look I mean look
37:49
so these two things I mean is the side of the side chain about being a puddle
37:52
Jair is the side chain approach and and I mean we spoke with such an guys
37:57
and the watching lies in you these people climb and when it up
38:01
us and and I like side chains but I like such an so that going
38:05
I'm the issue that I have with that is that then means our success or failure
38:10
is
38:11
indelibly linked to that point and
38:14
at all of any more than anything else and what I'd like to see
38:18
is a future with it regardless of what happens at the Queen
38:23
West Laurent Blanc and and I fear that
38:26
making paying us all to you bitcoins
38:30
mining it yet would but I said rest I'm on mole in more ways than one
38:34
who lookbook backing up on be all you
38:37
prevent that while back on or chrome
38:40
I mean like we were lost we could we could at a at a particular point we
38:45
could shove a
38:46
I am block ashen keep into the plains
38:50
chained reality is that I don't think that any
38:53
lightening we can build an automated system to check that
38:56
because I'm we didn't have to assume that people running the the Queen
39:02
Damon low-key and I don't have anyone going to manually check it because
39:06
people are lazy
39:08
but but I do i mean it is a good idea I mean be done some other stuff
39:11
I'm on the checkpoint in the check point inside all I'm
39:14
we you said we basically put checkpoints I'm
39:17
like informational checkpoints into TXT records on the bench to the mains
39:22
and then those prosecuted the NSA and
39:26
basically you actin it's just informational so you know if you
39:29
end up in a ball minutes ago I A you know I'm that this
39:33
but you can also enable and enable I'm
39:36
forcing compliance with those DNS checkpoints
39:39
so we have done some stuff like that City prevents
39:42
I'm rewinds in the tax and that sort of thing a I
39:45
and we're actually at the moment busy fiddling around with them
39:48
at been a difficult the algorithm cause we we talk a little bit block basis
39:53
but some I think it's it at the end of the day it does require stronger mining
39:58
at work
39:58
we're gonna somehow be you know or what we do is a
40:01
as a backup one simple question
40:04
arm wines that the pigeon
40:08
bozo then seems to be thoughtful I'm
40:12
well look the so so they we could cut that down to the
40:16
I like 23 and 5 you know whatever to
40:19
because you can make up most numbers from that all um backs
40:22
and and that would give us a large a mic settle some things
40:25
but at the end today did the powers of 10
40:28
whatever reason there in that moment and and the only way you
40:32
ninety change would want to make with that in the future is to go to a smaller
40:36
but
40:36
I'm said to domination netball Lodge in excess
40:40
that but that being said even people like really obscure denominations like
40:45
30,000 Mineiro I'm days at the reason
40:48
mixing sets so because you know that it's like that never gets painted long
40:52
as
40:53
it's been spent you know but others than in a green overspent small
40:58
cool in the ass
41:03
um everything is anonymous dennis is
41:06
am I able to check polo money like going wrote
41:10
yeah because remember you still see the Queen Bess transactional so
41:13
so you can see you going this transaction is going to be
41:16
but you can count them up on a block by block basis which
41:19
is obviously advantageous as well because it means that it is an
41:23
implementation detail yet
41:24
we can spot somebody creating not only will it yet but
41:28
good do you be months that you want and
41:34
for about Orleans on some other developments today
41:37
doesn't mean that that's one of the hardest on day
41:40
out like no other network that would point to yell the hype that
41:44
me if he suddenly got you Burton
41:47
developed and all yet all you think liked it better when the accelerate
41:51
its tale about that while you up the the development is I'm is one thing but in
41:56
the research side is another
41:57
I'm and the two go hand in hand like the
42:00
the them in a research lab guys some of them do some development as well but for
42:04
the most part they are
42:06
academics and so they're focused more on the
42:09
on the theory which is which is great basin sink yakking you're not a lot
42:13
absolutely is all
42:14
yeah so so but we need the research you know because the research
42:17
tends to identify problems that we don't think about because they run simulations
42:21
monarchist
42:22
and then his actual implementation and and I suppose
42:25
if there was a surge in developing interest that's great because then the
42:28
developments I did pick up and has lots of cool stuff that we could do you
42:32
but but the research side within lag you know but Norman you get a bit boats
42:36
you know it so see i mean if there was
42:38
sudden interest and and a lot of people and not take
42:41
not only in usage but in in on tribunal then we could dip in the sale things
42:45
from that perspective quite easy
42:50
where their
42:52
or what there or all
42:56
that sickness what we're all
43:00
work that mining probably going now
43:04
I ever where are the second person
43:08
week by week by I send why spend money
43:11
at by tomorrow a where do I send it on
43:14
yet that to all bets a combat possible
43:18
y'all okay so it's ok this question first I'm
43:21
the cheapest way to get an error I would imagine would be mining
43:25
I'm the mining at work I'll
43:28
I mean money with GV use at the moment is reasonably I i think is massively
43:32
profitable but you break even at least
43:34
um and and so I think that's probably the
43:38
like if you if you happen to have like 20 GB use lying around think that's
43:41
probably the the easy at the the cheapest let
43:44
I'm overpaid time for more immediate demand what is a bunch of exchanges you
43:49
know baloney X as its
43:50
Betty T-rex as a me and a couple others in second on the site
43:55
the not what he doesn't call its
43:58
remember it's not some folks from that point so we don't have because of the
44:01
capi
44:02
we don't a block notify we don't want to notify so exchanges go
44:06
I'm sorry you want me to do what couldn't and then they get very confused
44:10
and you can speak to someone is actually integrated Mineiro from scratch into
44:14
service and
44:15
it we had lots of angry words to say I
44:20
over how difficult it was its it's not easy because it's I'm
44:23
the is a lack of documentation any you know the libraries that ought not make
44:27
it a lot easier but it's so painful
44:29
so it's a couple any expert T-rex in a couple others Milotic and some others
44:34
um the downside of course is that baloney X is now just recently
44:38
introduced
44:38
I'm some AMC s a.m. okay I see stuff
44:42
that
44:44
for up to i think is two thousand dollars a day
44:47
is the is the entry-level limits and all you need to give them a
44:50
it by members like your name and email address all you name it by members I'm
44:54
just using that someone who
44:55
what we gonna do you um but yeah I mean that's that's unfortunately the the
45:00
inevitable
45:02
and inimitable thing that happens in dealing with exchanges
45:05
I'm a t-rex I think will eventually go that way as well said based in the US
45:10
I'm so ya think all it in the in the end it depends on
45:14
on what your I'm what your risk thresholds like
45:17
you know it you don't really K because once you got it in many road then
45:22
everything from there on out is irrelevant I'm then you know you Newegg
45:25
just using Exchange if you do can you worried about in mind
45:29
cool
45:32
anything else you got a question you he's asked about documentation
45:37
big but what about what is your ETA I like running at all
45:43
include how many hours a week go into OT job openings than
45:47
bill so you know I wake up in my mansion on
45:50
go to the pic map so it some
45:53
it is tricky you know like it is especially over the
45:57
over the the first saloon year pay I one in the challenges was that we had people
46:03
like hammering out some stuff all that I'll like our our priorities shifted
46:08
every day because then then this happened in that happened this person
46:11
needs less than oh my god how does mean there are not have agree
46:14
or of connects is on my smartphone I'll NBA we had an attack
46:18
there was somebody that figured out to an exploit I'm
46:21
that was loan expert ready but just wait a fork in it work
46:24
because of some from pussy toyed that
46:27
that just ended up basically like not being able to do you could use the same
46:32
hash
46:33
all a very large block I'm on each computer
46:37
and and that was a problem because suddenly the network for
46:40
the Saturday morning at like 3 o'clock in the morning or something
46:44
and I wasn't fun resolved itself in 35 minutes and the next action mall
46:49
but still it was at this message so it
46:52
and that doesn't that has already changed I mean it's it's calm down now
46:54
because we've had this
46:56
this initial flurry all a people who expected the price to shoot up to like
47:00
five billion dollars over night
47:02
and they've fallen away because a lack of interest
47:06
and that's been really advantageous because it means that we no longer have
47:09
constant pressure from
47:11
people who actually have no idea what it's like to do developmental
47:14
we um but there's a it
47:17
the possible that already interesting in the possible that are really annoying
47:20
but for the most popular typical day is like just have RC open in the back on
47:24
because
47:25
the most awesome thing you know check the forums apply to stuff because
47:29
the like sometimes as people saying idiotic stuff awesome questions that no
47:33
one's on said yea
47:34
I and then like that's probably like three hours of my day everyday
47:39
this like reading catching up all I'm stuff I missed overnight when
47:43
I went to see but if I could avoid sleeping anti-gay
47:46
and and then just you know it back black also emerges that's a that's what I can
47:51
you topics at the moment is
47:53
people submit pull requests and the know when tests
47:56
be I'm gonna go and Mac okay namaste is that Windows BBS the
48:01
by six 32-bit Windows 8 line-x that he did it
48:04
you know I mean like next minute its taking you back to our status when Paula
48:08
costs
48:08
so that gets frustrating as well and this is stuff that we're trying to do
48:12
I'm do to make that prices yet but it its
48:15
there's a lot of that stuff is low so the chunky black ongoing stuff
48:19
I'm and and and at the same time is still select do you like
48:23
continues integration infrastructure Sydney
48:25
don't up to taste everything manually but yeah it's
48:29
that's fine and incredibly infuriating it sensible
48:33
the you
48:37
haha wah
